    "A variable is a bucket or a basket. A bucket can hold things - what it holds depends on what we put in it - it can be toys for example. It is useful to put things in a bucket for specific operations, like taking the toys from one place to another. Or to washing the toys under the tap. Similarly, a variable can hold data in memory and allows a program to perform operations on the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to think of a variable is that we can do the same operations many times by using variables, which will become clear in an example below.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we can assign values to variables. Consider the variables a_number, another_number, and a_phrase :\n"
