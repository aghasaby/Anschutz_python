    "We have learned the different datatypes that we will be dealing with (e.g. strings, integers, floats, variables, etc.).  Most of the analyses we will want to perform will be applied to <i>groups</i> of these items.  For example, we might have a bunch of genes (strings), and we might want to look through that bunch of genes (let's call it a <u>list</u> of genes) and ask which have names that start with the letter Q.  OK, we will probably want to do something more interesting than that, but you get the idea.  If we are going to do this, we need to have the gene names organized into some sort of structure.  That's what this lesson is about.  Containers are objects that can be used to group other objects together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, for each container type, you need to be aware of three different properties:\n",
    "- <font color=red>**Mutability.**</font>  Mutable objects can be modified after creation.  Immutable objects cannot.\n",
    "- <font color=red>**Stability of ordering.**</font>  For some objects, the order in which items were added to the container is preserved. For others, it is not, and for all intents and purposes these objects have no inherent order.\n",
    "- <font color=red>**Indexing.**</font>  Indexing allows you to go in to a container and retrieve an object based on an given identifier. For some container types, this can be an integer (I want the <i>n</i>th item in the container **remember that python uses 0-based indexing!!**). Obviously, this approach is only valid if the container is ordered.  Other container types allow indexing with specific \"keys\" (more on that later)."

    "  \n",

    "  - `{3, 5, '6', 'dog', 'cat', False}`\n",

The most common conditional statement is an **if** statement.  It's exactly what it sounds like.  You are asking *if* the item meets some condition.  If statements are often paired with **else** statements.  *Else* statements define what to do in the case the *if* condition is not met.\n",

If it is not satisfied, we slip to the *elif* statement (remember it means else-if).  This is asking, given that condition1 is not met, is condition2 met?  If so, action2 is performed, and we move to the next iteration.  If neither condition1 nor condition2 are met, we slip to the *else* statement.  Action3 is performed and the iteration continues.\n",

Remember that '=' is used to assign variables.  The inverse of '==' is '!='.  '==' evaluates to True if the two items are equal.  \"!=' evaluates to True if the two items are not equal."
